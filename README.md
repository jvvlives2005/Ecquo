### Why we created the App: <br>
Problem: People have too many tasks and become overwhelmed due to no organization. Other apps do not facilitate in 
prioritizing their stuff, which leads to lack of self-discipline.

### Solution...Ecquo Planner! The app that will sort your tasks, and show ONLY ONE at a time. 

Taken from a man named Ryan on Reddit, the idea is to try at least 1 thing that you would like to do today and as you grow, you will attempt to do more each day. This is called "No Zero Days" and we believe using Ecquo Planner will help gain personal growth in terms of organization and time management.
